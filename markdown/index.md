Bedrock Linux
=============

Bedrock Linux is a meta Linux distribution which allows users to utilize
features from other, typically mutually exclusive distributions.  Essentially,
users can mix-and-match components as desired.  For example, one could have:

- The bulk of the system from an old/stable distribution such as CentOS or Debian.
- Access to cutting-edge packages from Arch Linux.
- Access to Arch's AUR.
- The ability to automate compiling packages with Gentoo's portage
- Library compatibility with Ubuntu, such as for desktop-oriented proprietary software.
- Library compatibility with CentOS, such as for workstation/server oriented proprietary software.

All at the same time, all working together like one, largely cohesive operating system.

A new video demonstrating such features as of the newly released Bedrock Linux
0.7 Poki is currently in development and will be listed here in the future.

An internal build of the upcoming Bedrock Linux release is now feature
complete.  Internal testing and bug fixing is now underway.

A release candidate is expected to be made public sometime in October or
November for further testing.  Any assistance testing at that time will be
greatly appreciated.  The proper release will follow, likely before the end of
2018.

## {id="poki-progress-2018-05"} May 2018 Poki Progress Update
<small>2018-05-05</small>

Given the relatively long release cycle, it seems prudent to provide an
occasional progress update.  Poki's development progress, updated 2018-05-05,
can be found [here](1.0beta3/progress.html).  While a substantial amount of
work has been done, much is left to do before the release is ready.
